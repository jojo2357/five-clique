For this branch, I adopted https://github.com/fabmax/five-word-sets and made it more compatible with n-size lists of n-word length. It did not complete six four-letter words after being given 10GB ram and one day of cpu core time. (~16 threads x 1hr 30 mins ~ 1cpu*day). And it only got to ~25% completion but my computer was getting hot.

The node.js branch took under 1 cpu hour and completed the task
